                    Created for my cumpulsion to watch ALL the videos in my subscriptions in the order they were released.
                    This web app is being developed to automatically create and maintain a database of videos to watch.
                    It uses <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2">Google OAuth2</a> to securely access your subscribed channels,
                    using this information and the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3">YouTube API</a>, a database of videos to watch is built for each user.
                    The app will be hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> Free Tier once it is completed.

            Developed during work for iCuris. I a needed to a simple software to quickly label image sets for training my neural network model. 
            There exsists solutions for single frame labeling such as <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT">Microsoft's solution</a> but I needed one for working with
            specifically groups of images. The app is currently prototyped using the Python library TKinter and specifically built for dealing with the datasets used in my work 
            at iCuris, but I plan on extending to variable input method.

            Cannot release details until the project is ready.
