# VR Learning Enviroment
### Third year project. 

Developing a suite of tools to aid in understanding and interacting with structures and models that
require more than 2 dimensions. Concepts such as gradient decent, hash maps, neural networks
and 3D path finding using A* can be quite difficult for beginners to grasp. These concepts are
fundamental to an education in computer science and the tools being developed make learning
them easier to learn through users being able to manipulate and visualize them in a 3D virtual
environment. To make the environment as accessible as possible, it will be developed/compiled
used web assembly to allow it to run in web browsers, allowing access from a wide range of
devices including mobile

Details coming soon.
