# Derivative Trade Monitor
### Group project
This was a group project, a core part of the Software Engineering module. The project was to develop a system to input derivative trades into a machine learning monitored system. The ML components detect potential anomalous data input by the user and alert them to confirm a valid input was given. Trades were then added to a database which could be view, edited or deleted. Daily reports were also generated using a scheduling library, these reports could be displayed in HTML or downloaded as a PDF.

### My role
I was put in charge of the front-end code, interfacing with the REST-API used for back-end functions. A demo of the project can be viewed below. Following the university regulation source code cannot be provided.
